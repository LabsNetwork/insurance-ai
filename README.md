# Smart Insurance Assistant

## Problem
People struggle to understand complex insurance policy documents, making it difficult to know what's covered and what risks they face when filing claims. This lack of clarity can lead to denied claims or incorrect policy selections.

## MVP Solution
Upload an insurance policy document → receive a simplified explanation of coverage and terms → get an AI-powered prediction of claim rejection risk before filing. This helps users make informed decisions and avoid preventable claim denials.
